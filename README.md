# Denver Sociodemographic Clustering

This is the repo for my capstone project at Galvanize's Data Science Immersive. The goal of the project was to use unsupervised learning and geospatial analytics to investigate sociodemographic changes in Denver from 2010-2015.

Data was collected from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) and the city of Denver's Open Data Catalog. 

Geospatial analytics were conducted for various parcel level metrics for each property in Denver. 

KMeans, Agglomerative and Two-Stage Clustering algorithms were run for annually for multiple combinations of property level metrics as well as ACS tract level data. 

A previous study, Studying Neighborhoods Using Uncertain Data from the American Community Survey: A Contextual Approach, conducted by Seth E. Spielman & Alex Singleton provided invaluable direction and insights for my project and must be credited as the foundation of my idea.
